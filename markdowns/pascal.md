# Pascal

Believe it or not, Pascal was in the top 3 languages when I was a teenager. Let's dive in!

## Checking the sample code

...except, it seems to be unsupported on `tech.io`...\
Which is understandable, given the fact, that it fell out of the top 100 languages by popularity long time ago.

So, instead of running my `Chuck Norris` sample solution in Pascal, let me show you a screenshot from Borland Pascal 7.0, an IDE that was ahead it's time 25+ years ago:

While I used to know `Pascal` "inside-out", I have largely forgotten it, so I will skip going into more details here.

## Resources to check

- [Overview on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal_(programming_language))
- Official tutorial: _NO, trust me, no-one is learning to code in Pascal nowadays..._
- But if you insist, you can check out [Free Pascal Compiler](https://www.freepascal.org/docs.html)

## Coming next...

After this short detour, let's continue with a language, that really stood the test of time: **C++**!
