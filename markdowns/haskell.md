## Checking the sample code

In the meantime, enjoy some Hello World!

```haskell runnable
import System.IO
import Control.Monad

main :: IO ()
main = do
    hSetBuffering stdout NoBuffering -- DO NOT REMOVE
    let m = "Hello World"
    -- hPutStrLn stderr "Debug messages..."
    print m
    return ()
```
