# Conclusion

It was a long ride!\
I hope you liked it, and also learned something new along the road.\
Thank you for your time!

## Where to go next?

- You are encouraged to (re)visit some of the [practice puzzles](https://www.codingame.com/training) on `CodinGame`, and try to solve them in a new language! Some frustration is guaranteed, but expect also some nice '_A-ha!_' moments. As a bonus, some CodinGame `achievements` will also unlock.
- Do some [Clash of Code](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/clashofcode) in a new language! Surely, you will loose many games in the beginning, but the best way of learning is by doing!
- Write a bot for a [multiplayer AI game](https://www.codingame.com/multiplayer/bot-programming)! Beat those lame _C++_ bots at the top of the leaderboards with a nice _Bash_ script! :-)
- Join [CG Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/466965651135922206/466965651135922208) or [CG Forum](https://www.codingame.com/forum/t/languages-update/1574) and harass all Codingamers and the CG staff by insisting to add support for _language X_! :-)
- Give me some feedback or pull request on how to improve this `Tech.io` playground! (Its source is available on [github](https://github.com/tbali0524/playground-dvtfkqgd).)
- Check out my other `Tech.io` playgrounds:
